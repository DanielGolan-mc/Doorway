# Doorway
*An experimental Discord API wrapper library written in Java. Overusing builders since 2022.*
## Why should I use Doorway?
- the syntax is imrpoved over other wrappers like JDA.
- Doorway doesn't use any external libraries at all, and only uses Java's built-in classes, providing improved Security.
- the installation is simple, and only requires your bot's public key.
- We do not support discord gateway, which heavily improves performance and network usage. Your bot will also be status-less.
- Doorway has automatic error handling, that'll send the user info about an error and why it happened. You can also use this system yourself!
## Why shouldn't I use Doorway?
- Doorway currently only supports interactions.
 - Because of this, new features are mainly gated behind Discord implementing new interaction types.
- Doorway is mainly a proof-of-concept, and a library I'm making for myself, and publishing to help other people not go through what I do. Features are prioritized appropriately.
 - If you want us to implement a new built-in event handler, or support a discord feature, just create an issue! We'll know you want it and priotize your request.
